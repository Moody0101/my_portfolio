        <h3 class="h3">Collecting information</h3>
        <p>
           this step is basically a general analysis concerning the project's goals, purpose, or overall concepts in order to understand the themes that could fit the ideas from the starting point to finish. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3 class="h3">Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
        making the boilerplate/assets, and identifying the tooling, languages, libraries, and frameworks to use based on the nature and theme of the project in hand.
        also this phase is where to make the visual concepts, if it is a web/gui project, other than a cli project.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h3 class="h3">code and organization</h3>
        <p>
            excitement starts in this phase in my opinion be cause I start really missing around and testing everthing I have prepared for, if I prepared well, then the debugging/coding would be a piece of cake. :)
        this phase consists of components:
        <ul class="comps">
            <li>code base organization</li>
            <li>code optimization</li>
            <li>debugging</li>
            <li>testing</li>
            <li>also, absolute frustration :)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
</section>
