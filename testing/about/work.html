            I am  moody,  a passionate programmer, I do the most of my tasks using python, but I can pretty much adopt to any other programming language   due to my deep understanding of the most  advanced concepts of programming and computer science.

        <span>
            I am a self-taught developer, I learned everything by my self.

            I love abstract art, illustrating abstract stuff, playing Minecraft, listening to the most loud music, the loudest the better for me.

            basically,  this is me.
